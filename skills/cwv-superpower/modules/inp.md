# INP Diagnosis Module

Invoked by SKILL.md with a target filter (`ff` or `u` with value) and device (default: mobile).

---

## Attribution calls

All calls use the provided `[FILTER_KEY]`/`[FILTER_VALUE]` placeholders for page filtering and `d=mobile` (or specified device).

1. **`get_metrics`** with `group: "inpel"` filtered by `[FILTER_KEY]=[FILTER_VALUE]`, device.
   Returns the slow interaction element (CSS selector).
   Note all segments — sometimes multiple elements have poor INP (e.g. a carousel button AND a hamburger menu). Each may have a different root cause.

2. **`get_metrics`** with `group: "lurl"` filtered by `[FILTER_KEY]=[FILTER_VALUE]`, device.
   Returns LOAF script URLs — the scripts running Long Animation Frames during slow interactions.
   For each URL, determine: first-party or third-party?
   Cross-reference with `inpel` results — e.g. `carousel.bundle.js` + `button.carousel-next` = near-certain match between script and element.

3. **`get_metrics`** with `group: "inpls"` filtered by `[FILTER_KEY]=[FILTER_VALUE]`, device.
   Returns the load state when the interaction happened.
   Possible values: `loading`, `dom-interactive`, `dom-content-loaded`, `complete`.
   - If `loading` or `dom-interactive`: script loading order problem — the page was still parsing when users interacted. Users click/tap before the page is ready.
   - If `complete`: event handler code problem — the page was fully loaded, so the slowness lives in the handler logic itself.

## Breakdown calls

One call: **`get_metrics`** with `metrics: "INPUTDELAY,PROCESSING,PRESENTATION"` filtered by `[FILTER_KEY]=[FILTER_VALUE]`, device.

INP breakdown phases and thresholds (from cwvmetrics.js):
- **INPUTDELAY** — good: <40ms, needs improvement: 40-80ms, poor: >80ms
- **PROCESSING** — good: <80ms, needs improvement: 80-160ms, poor: >160ms
- **PRESENTATION** — good: <80ms, needs improvement: 80-160ms, poor: >160ms

**CRITICAL:** Use proportional interpretation — the phase with the largest percentage of total INP is the bottleneck.
Example: INP=310ms, INPUTDELAY=190ms (61%), PROCESSING=80ms (26%), PRESENTATION=40ms (13%) -> bottleneck = INPUTDELAY.
Do NOT rely solely on absolute thresholds. A phase can be within its "good" threshold but still be the dominant contributor if the others are even smaller.

## Trend call

**`get_timeseries`** — 7-day window, day granularity, for INP filtered by `[FILTER_KEY]=[FILTER_VALUE]`, device.

## Interpretation — what each bottleneck means

### INPUTDELAY bottleneck

Main thread was busy when the user interacted — the event handler couldn't start.

**Common causes:**
- Large JS bundles being evaluated at page load
- Third-party scripts (analytics, chat widgets, A/B testing tools) running scheduled tasks
- Timer functions (`setTimeout`/`setInterval`) firing at the wrong moment
- Overlapping interactions queued sequentially
- Framework hydration blocking the main thread (React, Next.js, Nuxt)

**Chrome trace goals:**
Trigger the interaction from `inpel`. In the flamechart, look at activity BEFORE the event handler starts. Identify the blocking long task(s) — which script is responsible? Correlate with `lurl` results from CoreDash. If load state was `loading` or `dom-interactive`, look for script evaluation tasks specifically.

### PROCESSING bottleneck

The event handler itself is doing too much work.

**Common causes:**
- Synchronous DOM reads after writes (layout thrashing / forced reflows)
- Heavy computation in the handler (filtering large lists, complex state updates)
- Synchronous `localStorage` reads
- Large framework re-renders (React reconciling thousands of components)
- Deep cloning or serialization of large objects

**Chrome trace goals:**
Find the event handler in the flamechart, measure its duration. Look for purple "Layout" bars inside the handler (forced reflow). Look for long JS execution blocks. If a framework re-render is visible, note the scope (how many components) and duration.

### PRESENTATION bottleneck

The handler finished but the browser was slow to paint the result.

**Common causes:**
- Very large DOM (>1500 nodes) requiring extensive style recalculation and layout
- Complex CSS selectors being recalculated across the tree
- Non-composited animations triggered by the interaction
- Large DOM insertions or removals causing full layout
- Missing `content-visibility: auto` on off-screen sections

**Chrome trace goals:**
Look at rendering activity after the handler completes. Find "Recalculate Style", "Layout", and "Paint" blocks — measure their duration. Check DOM size (`document.querySelectorAll('*').length`). Look for non-composited animations. Check if `content-visibility: auto` could reduce layout scope.
